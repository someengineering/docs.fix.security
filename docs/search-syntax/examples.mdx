# Search Examples

Fix Security's search syntax is quite powerful and has many features. We suggest trying some of the following searches to get a feel for Fix Security's capabilities:

```bash title="Search for resources with property value 'foo'"
"foo"
```

```bash title="Get number of all collected resources"
all | count
```

```bash title="Get number of all collected resources by kind"
all | count kind
```

```bash title="List compute instances"
is(instance)
```

```bash title="List compute instances with more than two CPU cores"
is(instance) and
  instance_cores > 2
```

```bash title="List volumes that are not in use, larger than 10GB, older than 30 days, and with no I/O during the past 7 days"
is(volume) and
  volume_status != in-use and
  volume_size > 10 and
  age > 30d and
  last_access > 7d
```

```bash title="Count the number of EC2 instances by account ID"
is(aws_ec2_instance) |
  count /ancestors.account.reported.id
```

```bash title="Aggregate RAM usage (bytes) data grouped by cloud, account, region, and instance type"
is(instance) and instance_status == running |
  aggregate
    /ancestors.cloud.reported.name as cloud,
    /ancestors.account.reported.name as account,
    /ancestors.region.reported.name as region,
    instance_type as type:
      sum(instance_memory * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) as memory_bytes
```

```bash title="Aggregate hourly instance cost grouped by cloud, account, region, and type from the cost information associated with the instance_type higher up in the graph"
is(instance) and instance_status == running |
  aggregate
    /ancestors.cloud.reported.name as cloud,
    /ancestors.account.reported.name as account,
    /ancestors.region.reported.name as region,
    instance_type as type:
      sum(/ancestors.instance_type.reported.ondemand_cost) as instances_hourly_cost_estimate
```

```bash title="Find orphaned load balancers that have no active backend"
is(aws_alb) and
  age > 7d and
  backends==[] with(
      empty, <-- is(aws_alb_target_group) and
      target_type = instance and
      age > 7d with(
        empty, <-- is(aws_ec2_instance) and
        instance_status != terminated
      )
    ) <-[0:1]- is(aws_alb_target_group) or
    is(aws_alb)
```

```bash title="Ensure there is only one active access key available for any single IAM user"
is(access_key) and access_key_status = "Active" |
  aggregate user_name as user: sum(1) as number_of_keys
```

```bash title="Find expired SSL certificates"
is(certificate) and expires < @UTC@
```

```bash title="Find current quota consumption to prevent service interruptions"
is(quota) and usage > 0
```

```bash title="Find unused AWS volumes older than 30 days with no I/O in the past 7 days"
is(aws_ec2_volume) and
  age > 30d and
  last_access > 7d and
  last_update > 7d and
  volume_status = available
```
