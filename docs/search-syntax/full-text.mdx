# Full-text search

Each resource property value is indexed and searchable by Fix Security. Full-text search criteria is always enclosed in double quotes.

```bash
"167.123.13.102"
```

This command will search for above IP address in all properties of all resources. It splits the search term into tokens and matches those against the index.

## Combining search terms

It is possible to combine different search criteria with `and` and `or`. Above search could also be expressed like this:

```bash
"167" and "123" and "13" and "102"
```

but allows for any other combination.

```bash
("167.123" or "192.168") and
  "13.102"
```

## Combining other filters

Full-text search queries can be combined with other [filters](./filters.mdx) to narrow down the search results. Take following example as inspiration, that uses a [kind filter](./filters.mdx#selecting-nodes-by-kind) and [predicates](./filters.mdx#selecting-nodes-by-predicate) in combination with a full-text search term.

```bash
"167.123.13.102" and
  is(load_balancer) and
  age > 3w and
  nr_nodes > 0
```
