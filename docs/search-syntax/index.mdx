# Search Syntax

**Fix Security includes a powerful search engine.**

It allows you to perform a [full-text search](./full-text.mdx) to find resources without having to know the exact name of the property. You can filter results using powerful [filter criterias](./filters.mdx) and traverse the graph using [graph traversals](./traversals.mdx). Make sure to read how to [sort and limit](./sort-and-limit.mdx) the results.

Fix Security allows for [merging nodes](./merging-nodes.mdx), which can be a useful in case the information is not part of the node itself but in a reachable node nearby. It also allows filtering results with a certain graph structure using the [with clause](./with-clause.mdx).
