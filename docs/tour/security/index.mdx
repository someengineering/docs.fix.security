### Security Score

On the right side, you can see the overall Security Score, a weighted number ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best possible score, indicating no security issues. Critical issues impact the score more significantly than medium or low severity issues, reflecting their importance.

### Top Security Enhancements

Below the Security Score, this section lists the top 5 recommended security enhancements. These represent the most critical issues in your cloud infrastructure. Addressing these enhancements will significantly improve your security score. Each enhancement includes its associated resource type and severity to help you prioritize your actions.

By regularly reviewing the Security Dashboard, you can stay informed about the latest security issues and improvements in your cloud environment, ensuring that you take timely actions to maintain and enhance your security posture.
