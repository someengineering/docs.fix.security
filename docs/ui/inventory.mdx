This is the Inventory screen, where you can search through your entire cloud infrastructure. You can perform a full-text search to find specific resources and use filters to refine your search by account and other properties. The screen also allows you to switch between a Form-based search for guided queries and an Advanced search for free-form search inputs. In the center, you have a list of example searches that highlight common queries to help you quickly identify issues or resources within your environment.

## Search Results

<BrowserWindow

    alt="Inventory Search Easy"
    url="https://app.fix.security/inventory"

/>

The search results are displayed in a columnar format for easy viewing and analysis. Each result is presented with a set of default columns, including the kind, ID, name, volume status, last access, age, cloud, and account. Additionally, any column that is part of your search filter is automatically included in this view. On the right side, there is a download button that allows you to export all the results as a CSV file, enabling further analysis and reporting outside the application.

    alt="Inventory Search Advanced"
